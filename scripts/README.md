### Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have:

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Valid Sanity project ID and write token

### Example Output

The script will create a complete recipe document in Sanity with all the required fields populated. You can then:

- View the recipe on your website at `/recipes/[slug]`

- Add images to the recipe manually in Sanity
- Publish or unpublish as needed

### Troubleshooting

- **"No site settings found"**: Create a site settings document in Sanity with `published: true`
- **"No authors found"**: Create at least one author document linked to your site
- **"No categories found"**: Create at least one category document linked to your site
- **"API key error"**: Verify your Gemini API key is correct and has sufficient quota
- **"Sanity token error"**: Ensure your Sanity token has write permissions

```bash
npm run download-assets
```
